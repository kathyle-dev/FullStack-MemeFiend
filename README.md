# FullStack Meme Fiend

#### Project Scope: Create a Full Stack Application that requires user authentication. I chose to make a "Meme Fiend" Fan Site where the user can post a url of the meme they want and write a note about it. They can then "up-vote" or "down-vote" a meme by clicking on the arrows and delete a meme by clicking on the trash can. The memes are automatically sorted by total "votes".

# How it was made:
#### HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, API, JSON, Node.js, Express, EJS, MongoDB

# Lesson Learned:
#### I learned that when using a textarea, you must be cognizant of giving the area rows and columns, and to be careful to not accidentally add "whitespace" by breaking up the element's start and end tags.
